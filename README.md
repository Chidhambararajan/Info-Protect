# Info-Protect


Projects aims at encrypting all types of files.. we start with txt file encrypter



Text_file_encrypter.py instructions:

1/.The menu is well self explanatory

2/.The program asks for the pathname of the .txt file

3/.The password can also be a sentence(The more longer a password .. The more powerfull the algorithm becomes.. but the same doesnt apply 
when no of charecters in the .txt is less than the password length 

4/.The strenght of the encryption doesnt increase in any way by repeatedly encrypting the file by this same algorithm.

5/.Incase you forget any passwords .. dont worry usage log is there to save you.... in menu press 3

6/.Kindly enter only numbers in place of options input

7/.If you like the algorithm or any more bright ideas text me on code_machine_1434@protonmail.com or chidha1434@gmail.com


Gui versions are under developement.....
